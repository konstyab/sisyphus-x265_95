Summary: H.265 codec implementation
Group: Video

%description -n libx265_95
x265 is a commercially funded open source implementation of
the H.265/High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) compression
standard.  The x265 project is led by MulticoreWare, a
leading provider of high performance video software libraries.
The project also has several corporate sponsors whose generous
contributions have allowed the project to exist.

x265 is available under the GNU GPL v2 license.  Source code
is available from the x265 Project Page.  Development is funded
through license fees paid by commercial companies, who receive
a commercial license which is less restrictive than the GPL v2
(with respect to open-source requirements for the system that
integrates x265).  Pricing and commercial license terms are
available under a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  Please contact
us by writing to license @ x265.com.

The x265 team has licensed the rights to port and adapt x264
for use in x265.  Most of the video encoding algorithms developed
for x264 have been incorporated in x265, including rate control
functions, the lookahead function, macroblock tree, b-pyramid
and adaptive quantization
